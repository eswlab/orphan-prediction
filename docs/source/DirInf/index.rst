Automated pipeline
--------------------

We provide an **`automated pipeline`_** using  **`pyrpipe`**. and **`snakemake`**. This pipeline can be easily configured and executed in an automated manner.  **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**
The automated pipeline can be easily scaled on an HPC by executing multiple samples in parallel.
We recommend using this implementation of the pipeline for best reproducible results.
